2012-07-14  GoldenKevin  (revision 1)

	* Created /trunk folder to make layout more compliant with SVN best
	practices.

2010-10-10  GoldenKevin  (revision 2)

	* Initial import, with fully working Map.wz compiling and a fully working
	sample interpreter for map data.

2010-10-10  GoldenKevin  (revision 3)

	* Modified existing code to add an executable class for KvjInterpreter:
	kvjinterpreter.WzInterpreter. (MapDataReader, WzInterpreter, DataReader)
	* Replaced HashMaps in MapleMap with TreeMaps to keep the structures in the
	order of the keys. Added label to signify start of Footholds and Portals
	in MapleMap.toString().
	* Modifed Portal.toString() to only add parenthesis after the target map id
	(tm) if the target string (tn) was not empty.
	* Changed LittleEndianReader into an abstract class with two
	implementations: LittleEndianByteArrayReader for reading a byte array, and
	LittleEndianFileStreamReader for reading a file input stream.
	* Fixed problems with LittleEndianReader that were due to discrepancies
	between the unsigned bytes stored in the files and Java's signed bytes.
	* Changed the default path constants in the WzCompiler source file.

2010-10-11  GoldenKevin  (revision 4)

	* Modified XmlReader.traverseBlock so that it doesn't skip the first
	element. This was necessary for the addition of mob compiling. However, it
	came with a performance penalty and more complex code for map compiling.
	Now I really need to refactor that huge method.
	* Renamed Converter.handleSpecial to handleDir. Modified the parameters and
	return type so the data is written in the method itself and it doesn't
	return it as a byte array.
	* Cleaned up MapleMap.toString() in the interpreter. It now prints reactors
	and life as well.
	* Added mob compiling and mob interpreting.
	* Changed the default path (I'm now developing on a Windows environment) and
	the default wz file to Mob.wz.

2010-10-12  GoldenKevin  (revision 5)

	* Added toString method to kvjinterpreter.map.structure.Reactor
	* Renamed setTarget method in kvjinterpreter.map.structure.Portal to
	setTargetName. Modified comments in kvjcompiler.map.structure.Portal.
	* Added support for reactor compiling.

2010-11-19  GoldenKevin  (revision 6)

	* Complete rewrite of KvjCompiler. Expected behavior has not changed, and
	generated code should still be identical to previous revisions. Performance
	has been slightly hampered, as a trade off to simplicity. Code is more
	object oriented now, and it should make the addition of Item.wz compiling
	easier, which will break the current one to one file correspondence between
	the WZ files and the compiled binaries by compiling individual items as
	different files inside a folder that is named after the XML WZ file that
	contains the specific item.

2010-11-25  GoldenKevin  (revision 7)

	* Added preliminary Item.wz compiling as well as part of the Kvj parser for
	Item.wz. Please excuse all the comments in KvjInterpreter regarding items
	because it still is a work in progress after all.

2011-01-09  GoldenKevin  (revision 8)

	* Replaced references of FileOutputStream with a BufferedOutputStream that
	uses an underlying FileOutputStream. This should improve performance
	somewhat for KvjCompiler. Both the log file and the compiled binary files
	are now outputted with buffered output streams.
	* Replaced references of FileInputStream with a BufferedInputStream that
	uses an underlying FileInputStream. This should improve performance somewhat
	for KvjInterpreter when using kvjinterpreter.LittleEndianFileStreamReader.
	* Fixed the file names of kvjinterpreter.LittleEndianFileStreamReader and
	kvjinterpreter.LittleEndianByteArrayReader. The names were previously
	swapped. Also added a new constructor for
	kvjinterpreter.LittleEndianByteArrayReader that takes in a File and
	automatically fills the byte array.
	* Fixed Item.wz/Pet folder not being automatically created if it did not
	exist (kvjcompiler.item.ItemConverter).
	* It's 2011 now people! Added current year on all license headers.

2011-01-09  GoldenKevin  (revision 9)

	* Finished creating the sample interpreter for Item.wz. Unlike previous
	demos, there is no output and the class ItemConverter is only there to show
	how you can implement a ItemInformationProvider. You can modify the main
	method to output data for any item.
	* Fixed PET_CONSUMABLE_BY not writing the correct integer.
	* PET_EVOL_AMOUNT is no longer written in the binaries because its
	redundant. kvjcompiler.item.ItemConverter.getDayByteFromString now returns
	the java.util.Calendar constants instead of using magic numbers. The
	constants are equivalent though.

2011-01-10  GoldenKevin  (revision 10)

	* String.wz compiling is now possible and the corresponding interpreter has
	been released as well.

2011-01-12  GoldenKevin  (revision 11)

	* Added Skill.wz compiling. There are way too many properties to handle, so
	I won't add a sample interpreter. I think it would be easy enough to make
	one yourself. Also added a new method to kvyjcompiler.DataType to detect
	whether a property has two values (isPoint()).
	* Made the isNumber method from ItemConverter and StringConverter a public
	static method in kvjcompiler.Converter.
	* Input and output paths, as well as the WZ file and log file names can now
	be specified at runtime through arguments. A sample batch file for Windows
	is included with this update as well as a sample BASH script for Unix-like
	operating systems. You most likely have to fix the classpath if you are not
	using NetBeans, as well as the in and out paths that are specified in the
	batch file variables (I believe it should be KvjCompiler\bin for Eclipse).

2011-01-20  GoldenKevin  (revision 12)

	* Rewrote code for Skill compiling so that the effect codes aren't with of
	the rest of the Skill codes.
	* Fixed Skill RANGE being coded as MASTERY.
	* Item effects are now in the compiled binaries. Just like with Skill
	compiling, I got lazy with creating an interpreter that reads the effects,
	but you should get the general idea.
	* Fixed the batch scripts. They should now print out the correct name of the
	WZ files currently being compiled.

2011-01-20  GoldenKevin  (revision 13)

	* Fixed repeated Effects constant.
	* Cleaned up code that I meant to remove last revision.

2011-01-25  GoldenKevin  (revision 14)

	* Cleaned up MobConverter so that unnecessary bytes aren't written.
	* Somewhat started on Character.wz compiling.

2011-01-29  GoldenKevin  (revision 15)

	* Completed Character.wz compiling support.
	* Reduced size of Mob data a little bit.

2011-02-19  GoldenKevin  (revision 16)

	* Reduced size of Map data a little bit. Removed SelfDestruct structure of
	Mobs and replaced it with the selfDestructHp and removeAfter props.
	* Added drop chances to mob Kvj files by using String.wz/MonsterBook.img
	Note this probably won't work for any GMS version lower than v0.62.

2011-02-27  GoldenKevin  (revision 17)

	* Fixed Skill.wz compiling.

2011-03-21  GoldenKevin  (revision 18)

	* Reworked argument passing. Now you can specify multiple files to compile
	without having to re run the program, so your logs will not be overwritten
	for every WZ file you compile.
	* Fixed Reactor.wz compiling giving ClassCastException.
	* Fixed SkillConverter going into an infinite loop.
	* Fixed MobConverter giving NumberFormatException (does Bodyguard B really
	need to drain 50000 mp even though players have a max of 30000?)
	* Some integer properties were reduced in size to further save space.
	* Added summons to mob skills.
	* Added a way to add custom monster drops by means of editing
	DropConverter's source. One day, I may load custom scripts from a file so
	that you won't have to recompile the converter in order to change custom
	drops.

2011-04-13  GoldenKevin  (revision 19)

	* Updated status effect stat names to conform to ArgonMS r25.

2011-04-22  GoldenKevin  (revision 20)

	* Readded foothold IDs to Map.wz data.
	* Updated Linux launcher to support the new argument parsing system
	introduced in r17.
	* All files now have updated svn:eol-style and svn:mime-type properties.
	* Removed KvjInterpreter because it was extremely outdated. You may view the
	source code of ArgonMS to view an up-to-date implementation of a Kvj parser.
	* Moved files from KvjCompiler into the root directory now that it is the
	only project in this repository (since KvjInterpreter is now gone).

2011-04-23  GoldenKevin  (revision 21)

	* Escaped backslashes in CompileAll.bat to fix Windows issues.
	* Added support for Quest.wz compiling. Expect a lot of updates on this one
	though because right now, I'm not sure exactly what data the server needs.
	* Updated the README to reflect on recent (and not-so-recent) changes.
	* Updated CompileAll.* to include the default classpaths of both Eclipse and
	NetBeans. The versions of Java on my Linux and Windows boxes do not care if
	a classpath directory is non-existant, so there's no harm done. If your
	NetBeans project is named KvjBin and the project directory is set to the SVN
	root and you compile a dist/KvjBin.jar, or if your Eclipse project project
	directory is set to the SVN root, you should be able to run the program
	without modifying the classpath. You may still have to modify the WZ, out,
	or log paths however.
	* Various formatting changes to match standards set by ArgonMS. ChangeLog
	has been renamed to CHANGES and is now formatted according to a 4-space wide
	tab; @author javadoc tags have been added to each class file; and new lines
	have been added between license headers and package declarations.

2011-04-24  GoldenKevin  (revision 22)

	* Removed the passing of unnecessary indices to various quest structures.
	* Quest id is now a 2-byte integer.

2011-04-25  GoldenKevin  (revision 23)

	* Added several bits of quest data that I forgot to parse and write in the
	past two revisions (jobs, intervals, scripted quest names, minimum pet
	tameness, minimum mount tameness, required mesos, required world population)

2011-05-05  GoldenKevin  (revision 24)

	* No longer hard code the skills with charge. Instead, make the skill
	charged if there is a keydown property. This broke earlier revisions of
	ArgonMS, but ArgonMS r32 will now function correctly for all charged skills.

2011-05-15  GoldenKevin  (revision 25)

	* Quest.wz compiling added to CompileAll scripts.
	* Removed property for isBuff in SkillConverter. There are better ways of
	determining if a skill is a buff than by having to update a hardcoded list
	every version that introduces new skills. Plus it was a waste of space as
	the majority of skills are buffs, and each buff skill used up one more byte.
	* Renamed SkillConverter.IS_CHARGED to KEYDOWN, and added PREPARED and
	KEY_DOWN_END. Two properties that ArgonMS actually needs.
	* Added in info for summon skills.

2011-07-13  GoldenKevin  (revision 26)

	* Included script names for reactors, in case it may be used in the future.
	* Npc.wz compiling - currently only extracts the storage deposit and
	withdrawal fees and gets the script names for NPCs.

2012-01-29  GoldenKevin  (revision 27)

	* Updated copyright years.

2012-07-14  GoldenKevin  (revision 28)

	* Fixed compiling of point data types in SkillConverter.

2012-09-23  GoldenKevin  (revision 36)

	DropConverter.populateCustomDrops().
	* Tidied up whitespace and documentation in DropConverter.
	* Sap of Ancient Tree now has a four percent chance of dropping.
