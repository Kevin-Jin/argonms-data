	* Initial import, with fully working Map.wz compiling and a fully
	working sample interpreter for map data.

	* Modified existing code to add an executable class for KvjInterpreter:
	kvjinterpreter.WzInterpreter. (MapDataReader, WzInterpreter, DataReader)
	* Replaced HashMaps in MapleMap with TreeMaps to keep the structures in
	the order of the keys. Added label to signify start of Footholds and
	Portals list in MapleMap.toString().
	* Modifed Portal.toString() to only add parenthesis after the target
	map id (tm) if the target string (tn) was not empty.
	* Changed LittleEndianReader into an abstract class with two
	implementations: LittleEndianByteArrayReader for reading a byte array,
	and LittleEndianFileStreamReader for reading a file input stream.
	* Fixed problems with LittleEndianReader that were due to discrepancies
	between the unsigned bytes stored in the files and Java's signed bytes.
	* Changed the default path constants in the WzCompiler source file.
