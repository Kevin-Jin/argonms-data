* OPTIMIZATION AND CLEAN UP
  -The use of a byte buffer in LittleEndianWriter is redundant since we already
   use an OutputStream that buffers data for us. When I tried writing bytes
   directly to the OutputStream in LittleEndianWriter and then modifying
   MapConverter to use it, I saw a performance increase of around 200ms (I
   consistently seen differences on the scale of from 139xx ms to 137xx ms).
