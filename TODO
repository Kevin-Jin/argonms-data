* OPTIMIZATION AND CLEAN UP
  -The use of a byte buffer in LittleEndianWriter is redundant since we already
   use an OutputStream that buffers data for us. When I tried writing bytes
   directly to the OutputStream in LittleEndianWriter and then modifying
   MapConverter to use it, I saw a performance increase of around 200ms (I
   consistently seen differences on the scale of from 139xx ms to 137xx ms).
  -I think I should repack all items that share the same 3 digit prefix into a
   single file like the XML Wzs, and just load every item in that file at once
   on the server. NTFS' overhead is just too much for it. 4246 files that should
   only take up 54808 bytes of space takes up 15568896 bytes. That's a factor of
   284 times.
